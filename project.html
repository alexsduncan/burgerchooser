					<p>The Project</p>
				</div>
				<p>The purpose of Burger Chooser is to help you find a place to enjoy delicious burgers in the atmosphere most comfortable for you.
					While many dining decision aides - such as Yelp - require you to sift through a large amount of information and customer reviews,
					Burger Chooser asks you a few simple questions and uses your answers to guide you towards the burger joint you are most likely to
					enjoy.</p>
				<p>The restaurants chosen for inclusion in Burger Chooser are already somewhat renowned for their burgers, so instead of asking you
					what type of burger you'd like, Burger Chooser asks you what type of music and atmosphere you prefer when at a restaurant. After you have answered a few questions, Burger Chooser directs you to a page with information about the restaurant it thinks you will
					enjoy. The page mimics the "feel" of the restaurant both in terms of visual aesthetics and musical style to give you an idea of what
					it's like to be in the restaurant. Not to leave out food, though! The page also includes a picture I took of a burger I had when I
					visited the restaurant to collect data.</p>
				<p>There are currently 8 restaurants included in Burger Chooser; they are clustered around the
					Midtown, Downtown, and Edgewood areas. Click "The Restaurants" at the bottom of the page to see a map of the restaurants. Click "The
					Flowchart" to see a flowchart of the questions and answers involved in Burger Chooser.</p>
				<p>Burger Chooser was created as the final project for Dr. Carl DiSalvo's "Civic Media, Food Systems, & Interaction Design" project studio in fall 2013.</p>
